<h1 class="libTop">fusegen_c</h1>

This is common code for C packages generated by the Python **fuseGen**
script.

[fuseGen](https://jddixon.github.io/fusegen) is a Python program which generates
an Autotools-based ANSI C package compatible with the open source 
[FUSE filesystem in userspace package](http://fuse.sourceforge.net).  

fuseGen-generated packages are
meant to be templates, easily customized for different purposes.

## Project Status

fuseGen is a good beta, stable and well-tested.  fusegen_c is skeletal and
contains no useful code at this point.
